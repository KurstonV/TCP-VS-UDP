# TCP-VS-UDP

The TCP and UDP server and client can be run by just typing the Go run and the file name.

The test Harness does connect to the TCP server but not the UDP server but can easily be changed to to make it connect to the UDP server by adjust the connection code of the test hardness to "udp" and port number 8080.

The video was too big I could not fit it in youtube because the video was too long so it is on drive instead sorry for the inconvenience.


This project showed that TCP is more reliable and better to use for this type of chat based server.
